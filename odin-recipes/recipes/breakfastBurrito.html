    <p>
      Filled with spicy sausage, smoky scrambled eggs, shredded cheese, and a bright, fresh avocado-tomato salsa, these breakfast burritos are one of my kids’ most requested breakfast-for-dinner dishes. The inspiration for the recipe comes from Lake Anne Market, a hidden-gem bodega in my hometown of Reston, Virginia. From the outside, this place looks like a run-of-the-mill convenience store but in the back there’s an open kitchen with two ladies churning out authentic Latin American and Tex-Mex specialties. Heads up: the avocado-tomato salsa is spicy. If you’re making these for kids, consider omitting or reducing the jalapeño pepper (my kids actually prefer the burritos with no salsa at all).

      Looking for more kid-friendly, no-fork-needed Tex-Mex recipes? You can’t go wrong with chicken quesadillas or nachos.

    <p>Sally brought this recipe into the family when she was first invited to the sunday brunch. In true Watson style, Wilbur gave his girlfriend a beautiful green sundress, to show her off in while she met the family. Everyone loved her almost instantly, but what won her over with Ma and the Aunts was this delicious french toast. All of the kids loved it, and she made sure to cut it into small pieces for the lil'uns. She's a Watson family prize, that's for sure.</p>
